# MAX7219_DotMatrix
This is library supports the MAX7219 dot matrix display, The entire code was written from scratch within two days for a product but the concept of the design changed to NeoPixel RGB Matrix. So instead of making this code a waste, I have decided to make it opensource so that others can use it and upgrade to fit their project.
